	a lv2:Specification ;
	lv2:documentation """
<p>This extension defines a standard for generating web-based interfaces for
plugins. The goal of this interface is to allow, in a web-based environment,
an interface in which each plugin will have a representation, designed to look
like a real device, and they'll be connected to each other by cables, to make
pedalboards. Plugins implementing this standard will be compatible with the MOD device
and MOD host software.</p>

<p>In this interface, each plugin has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A pedal-like design;</li>
  <li>A footswitch that will bypass it;</li>
  <li>A light indicating the bypass state;</li>
  <li>Buttons that will control some most important parameters;</li>
  <li>Inputs and outputs in which cables will be connected;</li>
  <li>A clickable area to drag the pedal around.</li>
</ul>

<p>To provide the interface, the following resources can be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An HTML file defining the layout;</li>
  <li>A directory with static media that will be served to browser to build the
    interface;</li>
  <li>Special markup is used inside the HTML to define element's roles and
    funcionality;</li>
  <li>A screenshot and thumbnail of the plugin interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help the creation of interfaces, several base layouts have been
created. A set of backgrounds, knobs and slider images are available for
the plugin without the need of packing it inside the bundle. Any host that
implements this model should provide those resources. They're available in the
MOD SDK, that provides tools for building plugin interfaces.</p>
