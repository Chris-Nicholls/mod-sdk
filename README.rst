MOD SDK
=======

This SDK's goal is to allow LV2 plugin developers to implement the `MOD Gui extension <http://portalmod.com/ns/modgui>`. In MOD Gui, every plugin has a real pedal like representation in a web based environment, with several plugins in a pedalboard. For this, each plugin must have html code that allows the browser to properly render it.

This SDK provides the following funcionality:

* Allows developers to change the ttl, html and related files and imediately see changes
* A wizard for to choose and configure some interfaces that are already done, so that developer does not have to start from scratch
* Routines for installing the plugin at the MOD device / MOD host software and publishing it at MOD Cloud

To use the SDK, developers should put their LV2 bundles in workspace/ folder, inside the SDK, run a local webserver and open a webkit-based browser at http://localhost:9000. Everytime the page is reloaded, the ttl files will be parsed to display results accordinly.

Tip: follow the LV2 bundle recomendations and don't put several plugins in each bundle. If you do this, loading the page and generating thumbnails may take a lot of time.

Install
-------

These are instructions for installing in 64-bit Debian based Linux environment. It will work in x86 and Mac, but you might need to adjust the instructions.

The following packages will be required:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-pip git zlib1g:amd64

Start by cloning the repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/portalmod/mod-sdk.git
    $ cd mod-sdk

Create a python virtualenv::

    $ virtualenv modsdk-env
    $ source modsdk-env/bin/activate

Install the mod-python library::

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/portalmod/mod-python.git@new_interface#egg=mod-python

Install PIL (it needs this symlink to be compiled with zlib support) and tornado::

    $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib/
    $ pip install PIL tornado

If you use Linux, install pyinotify. This is used to expire bundle cached data when ttl files are changed. Without pyinotify no cache will be used. To install it::

    $ pip install pyinotify

Download PhantomJS::

    $ wget https://phantomjs.googlecode.com/files/phantomjs-1.9.0-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
    $ tar jxf phantomjs-1.9.0-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
    $ rm phantomjs-1.9.0-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2

Run the server::

    $ ./development_server.py

Open your webkit based browser (I use Chromium) and point to http://localhost:9000.
